# FusePort
A small but hopefully growing teleportation plugin for Bukkit.

## Features:
- Nothing

### Planned:
- Request to teleport to someone
- Request someone to teleport to you
- Teleport to position
- On click commands as chat feedback
- Go back to your previous position
- Setting: Allow bypass or block requests completly, as default and per player
- Permissions: In a way muli-level bypass permissions, for direct teleports
- Abort teleportation by move/clicking + timer

## Possible command setup:
- /tp - Tp to someone, if required request
- /tpr - Request to tp to someone
- (/tpd - direct, alt add '-d')
- /tph - Tp someone 'here', if required request
- /tphr - Request to tp someone 'here'
- (/tphd - direct, alt add '-d')
- /tpa - Accept ?latest¿ request
- /tpd - Deny ?latest¿ request

## Why another?
Since no other plugin known has all these features combined.
There are at least two specific servers (with custom solutions) which would gain by using this plugin.

Which features will be improved on these servers:
- Better commands (chat interface), also increase command consistence
- Multi-level bypass
- Setting: Default accept/request/deny
- Handling multiple requests at once.
- Nobody really has a good word for the 'a' in /tpa. Time to ditch it, tp accept does a better job!


PS: If you know a plugin which provides all these features, let 'me' know :)
